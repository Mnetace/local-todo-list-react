## Description

**NOW WITH LOCALE STORAGE**

TodoList implemented by scratch on React.js. It contains 3 types of filters namely "All' (which shows all the tasks), "Open" (only active tasks) and "Closed" (only closed tasks). I've learned web development myself so don't expect too much from the source code xD.

**This project is inspired by REDEV-community, which you can find out about [Here](https://www.instagram.com/redev_courses/).**

## How to use

### Add a new task

- **Click** on the input field.
- **Enter** the text of the new task.
- **Press** the "Save" button or the "Enter" button on the keyboard.

### Close the task

- **Hover** the cursor over the desired task (The task will be highlighted in blue).
- **Click** on the lock icon (The text will be crossed out).
